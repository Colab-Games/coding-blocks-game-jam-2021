# Coding Blocks Game Jam

This game was initiated in the Coding Blocks Game Jam of Jan/2021, but as lots of games of game jams didn't get finished, so it's now a project for us to experiment and learn about game development and Unity until the next Jam or project appears.

Game Jam Theme: Everything is Broken

## Game Mechanics and Story
You're lost in a weirdly quiety city, a lot of lights, but no signs of people. You try to jump and run around but somehow this feel impossible, the only way in is foward. Just ahead, a strong light coming from the ground followed by machine sounds, you must investigate.

In this dark room, with lots of machines and lighted by the screens, a control panel, with options like "Jump", "Climb" etc, above the names a cracked fusible for each option. "What is this supposed to be?" - you ask youerself - in this moment you notice a glowing green fusible shape in the ground. When you try to replace the "Jump" fusible you instantly are able to jump again.

On the other end of the room you notice a sign that says "Reset game ->" pointing for the darker side of the room, you go in. For some seconds you gasp for air and suddenly you're back to the first level.
